# AquaGuard
## Overview
AquaGuard is a smart water management solution designed to provide clean water and improved sanitation. The app utilizes machine learning models to monitor water quality and control filtration processes, ensuring safe drinking water for users. AquaGuard is built using Python and Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and management of water resources.

## Features
Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring: Continuously assess water quality using sensors and machine learning models.
Smart Filtration Control: Automatically adjust filtration processes based on water quality data.
User-Friendly Interface: Accessible and intuitive dashboard built with Streamlit for monitoring and controlling the system.
Data Visualization: Visualize water quality trends over time with interactive charts and graphs.
Alerts & Notifications: Receive real-time alerts on water quality issues or when maintenance is required.

Installation
- Clone the repository:

bash
- Copy code
- git clone https://github.com/ramodubjane/girlscode.git
- cd aquaguard

Install required dependencies:
- Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Then, run:


## Run the application:

- bash
- Copy code
- streamlit run app.py

## Usage
- Launch the app: Once the app is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to access the AquaGuard dashboard.
- Monitor Water Quality: The main dashboard displays real-time water quality metrics such as pH, turbidity, and other relevant parameters.
-Control Filtration: Use the interface to manually or automatically control the filtration system based on real-time data.
- View Reports: Access historical data and generate reports on water quality trends.
- Machine Learning Model
AquaGuardâ€™s machine learning model is trained to predict water quality based on sensor data. The model is built using Python and scikit-learn and is integrated within the Streamlit app to provide real-time predictions.
